Overview
---
This repository contains files for the Behavioral Cloning Project. The neural network is built and is trained to successfully run on both provided tracks. For the details, check [the writeup report](./writeup_report.md).

**Videos** of the neural network successfully driving a car on both tracks are:
* [first track (lake)](./videos/track1.mp4);
* [second track (jungle)](./videos/track2.mp4).

**Script and model files**:
* [model.py](./model.py) containing the script to create and train the model;
* [drive.py](./drive.py) for driving the car in autonomous mode;
* [preprocess.py](./preprocess.py) containing the script to pre-process the image for being passed into neural network;
* [model.h5](./model.h5) containing a trained convolution neural network;

**Writeup report**:
* [writeup_report.md](./writeup_report.md) summarizing the results.

### Dependencies
This lab requires:

* [CarND Term1 Starter Kit](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-Term1-Starter-Kit)

The lab enviroment can be created with CarND Term1 Starter Kit. Click [here](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-Term1-Starter-Kit/blob/master/README.md) for the details.
